Version 1.4c
This is a version 1.4 pre-release; Asymmetric ciphers have been added, along with preliminary work on the DTM-KEX.
Dual License: NTRU and DTM-KEX are GPLv3, everything else is MIT.

Major additions are: Ring-LWE, NTRU, McEliece, GMSS, Rainbow, Volume and Package factories, and the DTM key exchange protocol.

Library has tripled in size from the last release (now 46k+ lines), too much to explain here, I'll update the article when I get a chance..

Not everything is tested, or final, and changes will be made for 1.4d release.
